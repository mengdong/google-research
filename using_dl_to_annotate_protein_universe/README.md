This code is intended to support the publication "Using Deep Learning to
Annotate the Protein Universe". [preprint link](https://doi.org/10.1101/626507)

## Short description of files provided

A colab demonstrating usage of the available neural networks is in [Using_Deep_Learning_to_Annotate_the_Protein_Universe.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/google-research/blob/master/using_dl_to_annotate_protein_universe/Using_Deep_Learning_to_Annotate_the_Protein_Universe.ipynb).
This shows both prediction of Pfam families as well as how to produce an
embedding for a domain.

Code in the following directories is intended for documentation purposes, and is
not necessarily runnable. More information on these files is in a README.md in
each folder.

evaluation/

-   model accuracy
-   statistical significance
-   inference confidence
-   accuracy stratification based on sequence similarity, family size, etc.

hmm_baseline/

-   running hmmer and phmmer

neural_network/

-   constructing CNN
-   training CNN
